### Decoding Quantum Error Correction Codes with Local Variation

<div style="float: right;">2020</div>
Michael Hanks, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto

> In this paper we investigate the role of local information in the decoding of the repetition and surface error correction codes for the protection of quantum states. Our key result is an improvement in resource efficiency when local information is taken into account during the decoding process: the code distance associated with a given logical error rate is reduced with a magnitude depending on the proximity of the physical error rate to the accuracy threshold of the code. We also briefly discuss an averaged approach with local information for table-lookup and localised decoding schemes, an expected breakdown of these effects for large-scale systems, and the importance of this resource reduction in the near-term.

### Efficient compression of quantum braided circuits

<div style="float: right;">2019</div>

> Mapping a quantum algorithm to any practical large-scale quantum computer will require a sequence of compilations and optimizations. At the level of fault-tolerant encoding, one likely requirement of this process is the translation into a topological circuit, for which braided circuits represent one candidate model. Given the large overhead associated with encoded circuits, it is paramount to reduce their size in terms of computation time and qubit number through circuit compression. While these optimizations have typically been performed in the language of 3-dimensional diagrams, such a representation does not allow an efficient, general and scalable approach to reduction or verification. We propose the use of the ZX-calculus as an intermediate language for braided circuit compression, demonstrating advantage by comparing results using this approach with those previously obtained for the compression of $\vert A \rangle$ and $\vert Y \rangle$ state distillation circuits. We then provide a rough benchmark of our method against a small set of Clifford+T circuits, yielding compression percentages of ∼77\%. Our results suggest that the overheads of braided, defect-based circuits are comparable to those of their lattice-surgery counterparts, restoring the potential of this model for surface code quantum computation.

### Resource reduction for distributed quantum information processing using quantum multiplexed photons

<div style="float: right;">2019</div>

> Distributed quantum information processing is based on the transmission of quantum data over lossy channels between quantum processing nodes. These nodes may be separated by a few microns or on planetary scale distances, but transmission losses due to absorption/scattering in the channel are the major source of error for most distributed quantum information tasks. Of course quantum error detection (QED) /correction (QEC) techniques can be used to mitigate such effects but error detection approaches have severe performance issues due to the signaling constraints between nodes and so error correction approaches are preferable - assuming one has sufficient high quality local operations. Typical loss based QEC utilizes a one qubit per photon encoding. However single photons can carry more than one qubit of information and so our focus in this work is to explore whether loss-based quantum error correction utilizing quantum multiplexed photons is viable and advantageous, especially as photon loss results in more than one qubit of information being lost.

### Robust quantum sensing with strongly interacting probe systems

<div style="float: right;">2018</div>
Shane Dooley, Michael Hanks, Shojun Nakayama, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto

> In the field of quantum metrology and sensing, a collection of quantum systems (e.g., spins) are used as a probe to estimate some physical parameter (e.g., magnetic field). It is usually assumed that there are no interactions between the probe systems. We show that strong interactions between them can increase robustness against thermal noise, leading to enhanced sensitivity. In principle, the sensitivity can scale exponentially in the number of probes—even at non-zero temperatures—if there are long-range interactions. This scheme can also be combined with other techniques, such as dynamical decoupling, to give enhanced sensitivity in realistic experiments.

### High-fidelity spin measurement on the nitrogen-vacancy center

<div style="float: right;">2017</div>
Michael Hanks, Michael Trupke, Joerg Schmiedmayer, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto

> Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile candidates for many quantum information processing tasks, ranging from quantum imaging and sensing through to quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Critical to almost every potential application is an efficient mechanism for the high fidelity readout of the state of the electronic and nuclear spins. Typically such readout has been achieved through an optically resonant fluorescence measurement, but the presence of decay through a meta-stable state will limit its efficiency to the order of 99%. While this is good enough for many applications, it is insufficient for large scale quantum networks and fault-tolerant computational tasks. Here we explore an alternative approach based on dipole induced transparency (state-dependent reflection) in an NV center cavity QED system, using the most recent knowledge of the NV center's parameters to determine its feasibility, including the decay channels through the meta-stable subspace and photon ionization. We find that single-shot measurements above fault-tolerant thresholds should be available in the strong coupling regime for a wide range of cavity-center cooperativities, using a majority voting approach utilizing single photon detection. Furthermore, extremely high fidelity measurements are possible using weak optical pulses.
